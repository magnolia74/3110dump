DISCLAIMER!! Use the code at your own risk, I would recommend copy my own and turn it in your way. For this class, you do not run the code unless you want to edit or do guesswork.

If any person of the administration i.e. University want to "accuse" me of any "illegal" activity, read this -- I have NO RESPONSIBILITY of this code and anything goes with it. The code is open source and free and no plagiarism. That's why the author of this git remains anonymous. If you expose me of my real-life name under any circumstacnes, again, I have NO RESPOSIBILITIES! Again, I have NO RESPONSIBILITY!

Thanks.
